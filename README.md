# Mental Fitness Tracker

## Project Overview

The **Mental Fitness Tracker** project aims to analyze and understand the prevalence of various mental disorders in multiple countries from 1990 to 2019. The project's scope involves utilizing a dataset containing percentage data on mental disorders to identify trends, patterns, and changes over time. The primary objective is to gain valuable insights into the prevalence of mental disorders and develop strategies to support mental health initiatives, ultimately improving overall mental well-being in society.

## Target Audiences

1. **Individuals**: Individuals interested in monitoring and enhancing their mental well-being.
2. **Mental Health Professionals**: Professionals who use the data to understand and track their patients' progress.
3. **Companies**: Organizations incorporating the data into their employee wellness programs.
4. **Researchers**: Researchers utilizing the data to gain insights into mental health.
5. **Educational Institutions**: Schools and universities employing the data to support students' well-being.
6. **General Public and Advocacy Groups**: The general public and advocacy groups that use the data to raise awareness about mental health.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to train models using data on mental disorder prevalence to study trends and identify countries facing mental health challenges. By employing data-driven methods, the project supports more surveys and research, ultimately leading to effective actions to reduce the global suffering caused by mental disorders. Through data visualizations and analysis, valuable insights are obtained, with the aim of positively impacting mental health.

## Methodology

In this project, two different models were used to train and test the data, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of various mental disorders over time. After model training, user input was incorporated to make predictions about future mental disorder prevalence in specific countries. These predictions offer valuable insights into potential impacts, helping us comprehend how ongoing trends in data might affect a country's mental health in the future. The combination of regression models and data visualization provides a comprehensive approach to analyze mental health trends and make informed decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Processing**: Pandas and NumPy were employed for data preprocessing.
- **Data Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly were used for data visualization, enabling a comprehensive analysis of mental disorder prevalence over time.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression from the scikit-learn toolkit were utilized for predicting future trends due to the numerical nature of the data.
- **Data Normalization**: Label Encoder was used for data normalization.
- **Data Splitting**: The Train Test Split feature from scikit-learn was used for data splitting.
- **User Input Handling**: User input predictions involved converting a dictionary with appropriate data types into a data frame, facilitating seamless input for the model.

This project incorporates a variety of tools to gain insights into mental health trends and make informed predictions about future prevalence rates. It is intended to benefit people and communities worldwide by improving mental well-being and addressing mental health issues.
